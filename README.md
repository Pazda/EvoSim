# EvoSim
An evolution/natural selection simulator

Still early WIP

Try it here: http://eden.rutgers.edu/~ts857/

TODO:
- Improve UI... substantially
- ~Tweak numbers~
  - ~Natural selection isn't strong enough, trends are not noticeable but must be balanced with not causing mass extinctions~
    - ~Killing off weak members helped but populations go extinct too easily~
  - ~Populations are not growing, just fluctuating around a certain point~
    - ~If they have at least 2 good traits they will overgrow which is good~
  - ~Possibly kill off unsuitable creatures to make natural selection actually work?~
- ~Add a generation counter~
- Add overpopulation control
- Allow for custom reproduction & death rates ~as well as game speed (within the UI)~
