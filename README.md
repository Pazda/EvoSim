# EvoSim
An evolution/natural selection simulator
Still early WIP

TODO:
- Improve UI... substantially
- Tweak numbers
  - Natural selection isn't strong enough, trends are not noticeable but must be balanced with not causing mass extinctions
  - Populations are not growing, just fluctuating around a certain point
